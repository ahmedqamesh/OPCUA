        Args:
            ipAddress (str, optional): Network address of the AnaGate partner.
                Defaults to '192.168.1.254' which is the factory default.
            port (int, optional): CAN port number.
                Allowed values are:
                    * 0 for port 1/A (all AnaGate CAN models)
                    * 1 for port 2/B (AnaGate CAN duo, AnaGate CAN quattro,
                        AnaGate CAN X2/X4/X8)

                    * 7 for port 8/H (AnaGate CAN X8)
                Defaults to 0.
            confirm (bool, optional): If set to True, all incoming and outgoing
                data requests are confirmed by the internal message protocol.
                Without confirmations a better transmission performance is
                reached. Defaults to True.
            ind (bool, optional): If set to False, all incoming telegrams are
                discarded. Defaults to True.
            timeout (int, optional): Default timeout for accessing the AnaGate
                in milliseconds.
                A timeout is reported if the AnaGate partner does not respond
                within the defined timeout period. This global timeout value is
                valid on the current network connection for all commands and
                functions which do not offer a specific timeout value.
                Defaults to 10 s.
            baudrate (int, optional): The baud rate to be used.
                The following values are supported:
                    * 10000 für 10kBit
                    * 20000 für 20kBit
                    * 50000 für 50kBit
                    * 62500 für 62.5kBit
                    * 100000 für 100kBit
                    * 125000 für 125kBit
                    * 250000 für 250kBit
                    * 500000 für 500kBit
                    * 800000 für 800kBit (not AnaGate CAN)
                    * 1000000 für 1MBit
            operatingMode (int, optional): The operating mode to be used.
                The following values are allowed:
                    * 0 = default mode.
                    * 1 = loop back mode: No telegrams are sent via CAN bus.
                        Instead they are received as if they had been
                        transmitted over CAN by a different CAN device.
                    * 2 = listen mode: Device operates as a passive bus
                        partner, meaning no telegrams are sent to the CAN bus
                        (nor ACKs for incoming telegrams).
                    * 3 = offline mode: No telegrams are sent or received on
                        the CAN bus. Thus no error frames are generated on the
                        bus if other connected CAN devices send telegrams with
                        a different baud rate.
            termination (bool, optional): Use integrated CAN bus termination
                (True=yes, False=no). This setting is not supported by all
                AnaGate CAN models.
            highSpeedMode (bool, optional): Use high speed mode (True=yes,
                False=no). This setting is not supported by all AnaGate CAN
                models.
                The high speed mode was created for large baud rates with
                continuously high bus load. In this mode telegrams are not
                confirmed on the protocol layer and the software filters
                defined via CANSetFilter are ignored.
            timeStampOn (bool, optional): Use time stamp mode (True=yes,
                False=no). This setting is not supported by all AnaGate CAN
                models.
                In activated time stamp mode an additional timestamp is sent
                with the CAN telegram. This timestamp indicates when the
                incoming message was received by the CAN controller or when the
                outgoing message was confirmed by the CAN controller.
            maxSizePerQueue (int, optional): Maximum size of the receive
                buffer. Defaults to 42.

                        transmitted over CAN by a different CAN device.
                    * 2 = listen mode: Device operates as a passive bus
                        partner, meaning no telegrams are sent to the CAN bus
                        (nor ACKs for incoming telegrams).
                    * 3 = offline mode: No telegrams are sent or received on
                        the CAN bus. Thus no error frames are generated on the
                        bus if other connected CAN devices send telegrams with
                        a different baud rate.
            termination (bool, optional): Use integrated CAN bus termination
                (True=yes, False=no). This setting is not supported by all
                AnaGate CAN models.
            highSpeedMode (bool, optional): Use high speed mode (True=yes,
                False=no). This setting is not supported by all AnaGate CAN
                models.
                The high speed mode was created for large baud rates with
                continuously high bus load. In this mode telegrams are not
                confirmed on the protocol layer and the software filters
                defined via CANSetFilter are ignored.

                False=no). This setting is not supported by all AnaGate CAN
                models.
                In activated time stamp mode an additional timestamp is sent
                with the CAN telegram. This timestamp indicates when the
                incoming message was received by the CAN controller or when the
